
## Project Overview

This project is designed to showcase advanced SQL querying techniques through the analysis of over 1 million rows of Apple retail sales data. The dataset includes information about products, stores, sales transactions, and warranty claims across various Apple retail locations globally. By tackling a variety of questions, from basic to complex, you'll demonstrate your ability to write sophisticated SQL queries that extract valuable insights from large datasets.

The project is ideal for data analysts looking to enhance their SQL skills by working with a large-scale dataset and solving real-world business questions.

   - `city`: City where the store is located.
   - `country`: Country of the store.

2. **category**: Holds product category information.
   - `category_id`: Unique identifier for each product category.
   - `category_name`: Name of the category.

3. **products**: Details about Apple products.
   - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `product_name`: Name of the product.
   - `category_id`: References the category table.
   - `launch_date`: Date when the product was launched.
   - `price`: Price of the product.

4. **sales**: Stores sales transactions.
   - `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.
   - `sale_date`: Date of the sale.
   - `store_id`: References the store table.
   - `product_id`: References the product table.
   - `quantity`: Number of units sold.

5. **warranty**: Contains information about warranty claims.

   - `sale_id`: References the sales table.
   - `repair_status`: Status of the warranty claim (e.g., Paid Repaired, Warranty Void).

## Objectives

The project is split into three tiers of questions to test SQL skills of increasing complexity:

### Easy to Medium (10 Questions)

1. Find the number of stores in each country.
```sql
select country,count(1) as no_of_stores 
from stores
group by country
order by 1;
```
2. Calculate the total number of units sold by each store.
```sql
select s.store_id,st.store_name, 
		sum(s.quantity) as total_units_sold
from sales s
join stores st
on s.store_id = st.store_id
group by 1,2
order by 3 desc;
```
3. Identify how many sales occurred in December 2023.
```sql
select count(1) as sales_count
from sales
where extract(month from sale_date) = 12 and
		extract(year from sale_date) = 2023;
		
-- or

select count(1) as total_sales
from sales
where to_char(sale_date, 'mm-yyyy') = '12-2023';
```
4. Determine how many stores have never had a warranty claim filed.
```sql
select count(1)
from stores 
where store_id not in (select distinct s.store_id
					  from warranty w
					  left join sales s
					  on s.sale_id = w.sale_id)
```
5. Calculate the percentage of warranty claims marked as "Rejected".
```sql
with cte as(
	select *, case
					when repair_status = 'Rejected' then 1
					else 0
					end as rejected_count
	from warranty)
select round(sum(rejected_count)/count(1)::numeric*100,2) as pct_rejected from cte;

-- or

from warranty
where repair_status = 'Rejected';
```
6. Identify which store had the highest total units sold in the last year(2023).

		 when s.sale_date between p.launch_date + interval '6 month' and p.launch_date + interval '12 month' then '6-12 months'
		 when s.sale_date between p.launch_date + interval '12 month' and p.launch_date + interval '18 month' then '12-18 months'
		 else '18+ months'
	end as time_period,
